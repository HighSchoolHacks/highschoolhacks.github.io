      <p><i>Tech Retreat is a student-led initiative designed to inspire high school students from all backgrounds through a collaborative exploration of technology.</i></p>

      <h3>The Quick Version</h3>

      <p>Tech Retreat is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, and religion
        (or lack of any of the aforementioned). We aim to provide an enjoyable experience without regards for your previous hackathon attendance or computing experience. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and
        imagery is not appropriate at any location before, during and after the event, including hacks, talks, workshops, social media and other online media. Cyberbullying, stalking and the spread of rumors are also not tolerated. Hackathon
        participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon and learnathon at the discretion of the hackathon organisers. Parents and guardians will also be notified in any case. Additionally, we do not tolerate
        disturbing any presentations, and any act that could disrupt the flow of the event.</p>

      <h3>The Less Quick Version</h3>

      <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual images in public spaces,
        deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. This includes
        anything happening at the event, and online before and after the event.</p>

      <p>
        Participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable
        expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).</p>

      <p>
        Participants are expected to not disturb any presentations, and we ask participants to refrain from any act that could disrupt the flow of the event, such as heckling, yelling, etc.</p>

      <p>
        Participants asked to stop any harassing and disruptive behavior are expected to comply immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        As this is a hackathon/learnathon we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at our event are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.
        Sponsors, mentors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised
        clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mentors are expected to offer guidance to students with respect, and the same is expected of students towards mentors.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a volunteer or organizer immediately.
        Hackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your
        attendance.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the hackathon with no refund (if applicable)..
      </p>

      <p>
        We expect participants to follow these rules at hackathon and workshop venues and hackathon-related social events.
