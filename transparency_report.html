  <h1 class="centered">Transparency Report 2015</h1>
  <p>We hope you had a great time at this year's Tech Retreat. We started organizing this event in May (technically April, but we also had exams) and throughout that process, one of our core values has always been, and will continue to be, transparency. That’s why we’re publishing this - our <b>Transparency Report</b>. So, without further adieu, here we go!</p>
  <h2>The Team</h2>
  <p>The Tech Retreat organizing team is comprised of <b>19</b> students, most of which are from the University of Waterloo and are in their first year of studies. We also have one organizer from Simon Fraser University.</p>
  <p>We had a contingent of <b>15</b> volunteers and <b>32</b> mentors, without whom the event would not have been possible!</p>
  <img src="img/some_of_the_team.jpg" class="centered" />
  <p class="caption">(Some of) the team!</p>
  <h2>Finance</h2>
  <p>Time to crunch the numbers. We received a total of $5250 from our amazing sponsors. Sponsors who supported us financially include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Communitech and Enflick as our gold sponsors
      </li>
      <li>
        Shopify as our silver sponsor
      </li>
      <li>
        Velocity and Accelerator Center as bronze sponsors
      </li>
      <li>
        The Department of Software Engineering of the University of Waterloo
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The $5250 was spent accordingly:</p>
    <div id="cashmoney" style="min-width: 310px; height: 400px;" class="graph"></div>
    <p class="caption">Total Expenses: $5115.83. The extra $100 will go towards Tech Retreat 2016.</p>
  </p>

  <h2>Outreach</h2>
  <p>As this was the first year Tech Retreat was running, we directly reached out to high school students and surveyed their interest in a hackathon and learnathon solely for secondary school students. </p>
  <p>We contacted a total of 22 high schools from the GTA and Waterloo regions in order to target students who can easily reach The University of Waterloo either by car or by public transportation. We reached out to each high school’s computer science and robotics clubs’ members. On top of that, we marketed Tech Retreat on Twitter and on Facebook to spread the word to even more potential participants.</p>

  <h2>Acceptances</h2>
  <p>Tech Retreat received <b>470</b> valid applications (from <b>504</b> total applications) over the course of 2 months. This number does not include duplicate, incomplete or any applications with obvious fake names. This was a lot more than we had expected and we had to trim the list down to <b>166</b> learners and hackers.
  <p>In order to make the admissions process as fair as possible, the organizing team decided that each application had to be looked over by at least 3 organizers, who would then give the candidate a score out of 10. For the hackathon, we looked for experience and passion for the event. As for the learnathon, we only took into account the candidate's will to learn. All other submitted information were deliberately hidden from the organizers during the selection process.</p>
  <img class="centered" src="img/transparency_report/yum_data.png"/>
  <p class="caption">Yum... Data.</p>

  <p>After each applicant was given 3 scores by the assigned organizers, we normalized every score a given organizer gave in order to avoid bias with some organizers assigning a higher or lower grade than others.</p>
  <p>Then, we decided on a cutoff score to admit a portion of hackers and learners for the first round. In cases where we believed that the applicant's skills and abilities were a better fit for the other stream, we asked the hacker/learner to switch streams. Then we sent out the acceptance letters, and waited.</p>
  <p>Based on the number of replies, we sent out more acceptances for round 2, 3 and so on.</p>
  <p>Due to a mistake in the way the hackathon admission information was handled, the first 3 rounds of admissions relied on incorrect scores. We caught this mistake at a later stage during the admissions process, corrected the data, and sent out invitations for the hackers who were wrongly penalized in round 4. No one was retroactively rejected from this incident.</p>
  <h2>Admissions at a glance</h2>

      <p>learners accepted</p>
    </div>
  </div>
    <h2>Who are the students?</h2>
    <p>We received applications from students of all walks across Ontario, but most of them came from the GTA area. Notably, 57 applicants came from Brampton, 105 from Mississauga, 95 from Toronto, 32 from Waterloo, 30 from Richmond Hill, 20 from Windsor and 18 from Kitchener.</p>
    <p>As for gender distribution, our initial pool of applicants was 19.64% female. After the admission process, 12% of those admitted into the hackathon were female and 19% of those in the learnathon were female. This is a key area we will be working on to improve for the next iteration of Tech Retreat.</p>
    <p>Also, it might be interesting to look at the last completed grade of the applicants. Graph time!</p>
      <div id="grade" style="min-width: 310px; height: 400px;" class="graph"></div>
      <div id="genderapplicant" style="min-width: 310px; height: 200px; max-width: 600px;" class="graph"></div>
      <div id="genderaccepted" style="min-width: 310px; height: 200px; max-width: 600px;" class="graph"></div>
      <p class="caption">The most common Tech Retreat participant would be a male, in grade 11 or 12, and coming from Mississauga.</p>
  <h2>Experience and Interest</h2>
      <p>According to the applications, here are what students are most most likely to have experience in these technologies (by searching for keywords in the text that was included in the application):</p>
      <div id="experience" style="min-width: 300px; height: 400px;" class="graph"></div>
      <div id="interest" style="min-width: 300px; height: 400px;" class="graph"></div>
      <h2>Hacker Relations</h2>
      <p>We sent a lot of emails out to you. In total… we sent out a total of 56 Mailchimp campaigns (we sent different emails to different streams), which totalled 3579 emails. We've also received over 60 questions on Facebook about the event, and many more via email.</p>
      <p>We have 164 likes on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kwtechretreat">Facebook page</a> and 142 <a href="https://twitter.com/TechRetreat">Twitter followers</a>. You should totally like us or follow us if you haven’t already! ;)</p>
      <p>A total of 239 people (organizers, volunteers, mentors, sponsors, hackers) were on Slack. In total, we sent 23.7K messages - 10K (42%) in channels, 5.9K (25%) in groups, and 7.8K (33%) in private messages. As a group, we also stored 165 files, totalling 200 MB. </p>
      <p>During the day of the event, we had a surprisingly high retention rate as the overwhelming majority of the admitted students showed up! <b>89%</b> or <b>148 out of 166</b> students arrived the morning of the event. You guys rock!</p>
      <p>We also had a contingent of <b>15</b> volunteers and <b>32</b> mentors, without whom the event would not be possible!</p>
      <p>We used DevPost for judging and showcasing Hackathon projects - in total, we received <b>27</b> submissions. For the software learnathon, we had <b>17</b> tanks that were submitted into the final showdown!</p>

      <h2>Logistics</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <p>Aha. This is a fun one. We’ll start with food - who doesn’t love food? :D</p>
          <p>Our wonderful sponsor Enflick covered lunch for us, so we don’t have the stats for that. For dinner, we bought 80 pizzas for a total of 800 slices. We also bought 600 bags of chips and 840 cans of pop/juice. </p>
          <p>We want to hear what you want for food at 2016’s Tech Retreat - let us know! :)</p>
          <p>We also ordered 250 lanyards and badges, 200 stickers, and 250 T-Shirts (Psst. If anyone has an extra red shirt lying around… send it Deon’s way - he wants one), and a bunch of plates/napkins/forks for lunch. </p>
          <p>In terms of visuals, we bought a photo backdrop (hopefully you had a chance to take a photo!), a banner to guide you to us, and lawn signs to direct you to Mathematics 3. We used 8 different spaces for Tech Retreat, so we also printed 66 signs to direct you to the right place. </p>

      <h2>Open Source</h2>
      <p>All code and teaching documents developed for Tech Retreat are fully open source and they can be found on <a href="https://github.com/TechRetreat">our GitHub organization</a>.</p>
      <p>Among them, <a href="http://techtanks.techretreat.ca/">TechTanks</a> is a game we’ve developed to teach Ruby programming to novice coders by allowing them to create the AI for a tank, and then to fight each other. A lot of the code for this project was forked off RTanque, which itself is an open source clone of the popular RoboCode game. TechTanks is still online and we will be keeping it online indefinitely for your enjoyment!</p>

      <h2>Comments from Participants</h2>
      <h3>Time</h3>
      <p>Time? Before Tech Retreat started, we sent out an email to those of you who subscribed to our mailing list asking if you wanted a one-day or two-day program (stay in residence included overnight). </p>
      <p>We received a total of 75 responses for this survey.</p>

      <div class="row">
      <div class="qa">
      <h1>Do you want, and are you able to attend, a two day Tech Retreat?</h1>
      <p>Yes - 68 (90.7%)</p>
      <p>No - 7 (9.3%)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa">
      <h1>If you said "Yes" to the question above, would you like to stay in residence, or stay at home overnight?</h1>
      <p>In Residence - 63 (92.6%)</p>
      <p>At Home - 5 (7.4%)</p>
      </div>
      </div>

      <p>From this, we can tell that you were very enthusiastic about having a two-day event, but unfortunately we weren’t able to run a two-day Tech Retreat this year because of logistical and financial constraints. </p>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, we sent out a feedback survey - one of those questions was:</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="qa">
          <h1>Were you able to finish your project up to the point that you would have liked?</h1>
      <p>Yes - 21 (44.7%)</p>

      <p>No - 26 (55.3%)</p>
        </div>

      <p class="caption">We got 47 replies to this question. </p>
      <p>The data is clear above - a slight majority of you would have liked more time to work on your projects. We definitely feel where you’re coming from and we will make a push to make Tech Retreat a two-day event in 2016. </p>
      <h3>Mentors</h3>
      <p>Learning and helping out students is a core element of Tech Retreat, and to make sure of that, we had a 1:5 mentor to student ratio. One of useful vital statistics is to see if participants had help when they needed it.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="qa">
          <h1>Did you or your team ask for a mentor's help?</h1>


      <p>Yes - 37 (77.1%)</p>

      <p>No - 11 (22.9%)</p>
        </div>

      <p class="caption">We got 47 replies to this question. </p>
      </div>
      <p>Hopefully all of that info satisfied your curiosity about Tech Retreat! 'Till next year, everyone! We have a lot of cool things planned for you all.</p>
